🧠 Database Normalization Mini Project (UNF → 4NF)
📘 Overview

This mini project demonstrates the concept of Database Normalization — the process of organizing data in a relational database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
Using SQL (Oracle/MySQL), this project walks through each normalization stage: Unnormalized Form (UNF) to Fourth Normal Form (4NF).

🧩 Normalization Stages

UNF (Unnormalized Form):
Raw data with repeating groups and redundant information.

1NF (First Normal Form):
Atomic values, removing repeating groups.

2NF (Second Normal Form):
Eliminating partial dependencies by separating tables.

3NF (Third Normal Form):
Removing transitive dependencies (non-key dependencies).

BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form):
Ensuring every determinant is a candidate key.

4NF (Fourth Normal Form):
Removing multi-valued dependencies (e.g., students with multiple hobbies).

💻 Technologies Used

SQL / Oracle / MySQL

Database Concepts: Keys, Constraints, Dependencies

🧠 Key Learnings

✔ Data redundancy reduction
✔ Improved database efficiency and consistency
✔ Practical understanding of normalization rules
✔ Use of primary and foreign keys to maintain relationships

📊 Example Use Case

Normalization applied to a Student Dataset containing Subjects, Marks, Instructors, and Hobbies — demonstrating how structured database design enhances reliability and scalability.

🚀 Outcome

This project provides a hands-on understanding of how normalization transforms unstructured data into an optimized, well-organized relational database — a core concept in DBMS and data management.
